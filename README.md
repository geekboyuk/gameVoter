# Voter.js - a discussion

This is purely intended as a discussion point about allocating people to games at game conferences.

## Notes

1. The code here is purely for discussion in terms of the viability of automating the process.
2. The code isn't here to be critiqued, in terms of quality, it was badly hacked one night.  See Note 1.  
3. It is not meant to be used as is; getting users to type in their votes in such a crazy manner is obviously ridiculous.  See Note 1.
4. I've ideas on how the UI can be achieved in a frictionless manner, don't waste time discussing here. See Note 1.
5. Basically: Note 1!

## Getting Started
